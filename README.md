In this mini-project, you will develop models to classify the image data. You will use the combo MNIST dataset
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/comp-551-fall-2021/data) provided to you for this problem. Combo MNIST dataset has
60,000 images for training your classifier. Out of the 60,000 training images, 30,000 images have labels associated
with them. The remaining 30,000 images do not have labels. You can get creative to use them to train your classifier.
Sample images are shown in Figure 1 to give you an idea of the image dataset. The dataset also comes with 15,000
test images whose predictions has to be uploaded to Kaggle to get a score. Roughly 40% these 15,000 images are used
to show the rankings in the public leaderboard, while the remaining 60% form private leaderboard which is hidden
from everyone. The final rankings are based on the private leaderboard. Please read the evaluation page on Kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/comp-551-fall-2021/overview/evaluation) carefully for formatting your submission file.
